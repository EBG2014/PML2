### Practical Machine Learning Course Project
### Peer Reviewers Please read
##### The files for the Practical Machine Learning Course Project are in the gh project branch 
##### There are three files:

- **course_project.html** *The official "submission" for the project*
- **course_project.rmd**  *The R markdown rmd file that was run in R-studio*
- **course_project.md**   *The  R markdown file output as a markdown document (using knit2html() in the R console)*

##### The course_project.rmd file is the knitr file that creates both the html output and the markdown file (md) 
##### The html file is the official submission for the project.  To compile the file use the link:
